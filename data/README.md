# Data Directory

This directory contains all JSON files used in the experiments.
All datasets are **synthetically generated** and derived from controlled event elements.
No real-world personal data is included.

## 1. `elements/common_elements.json`

**Purpose**  
Provides the shared primitive elements used to construct all events.

**Contents**
- `locations`: list of location strings
- `temporals`: list of dates in `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format
- `entities`: list of full person names
- `contents`: list of action / event descriptions

**Usage**
- Input to all downstream generation steps:
  - story generation
  - distractor generation
  - QA generation (indirectly via stories)

---

## 2. `stories/base_data.json`

**Purpose**  
Core dataset containing event structures and their corresponding
high- and low-narrativity texts.

**Generated by**
- `scripts/02_generate_stories.py`

**Structure (per chapter)**

```json
{
  "chapter": 0,
  "events": [
    {
      "entity": "...",
      "location": "...",
      "temporal": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "content": "..."
    }
  ],
  "high_narrativity_text": "...",
  "low_narrativity_text": "..."
}
```

**Notes**
- Each chapter contains a fixed number of events (default: 10).
- High- and low-narrativity texts are generated from identical events.
- No additional metadata (e.g., adequacy flags) is stored.

---

## 3. `distractors/distractor.json`

**Purpose**  
Interference texts appended during recall experiments.

**Generated by**
- `scripts/03_generate_distractors.py`

**Distractor Types**
- MI (Meaningless Interference): token repetition without semantic content
- RI (Related Interference): shares entities with the chapter events
- UI (Unrelated Interference): uses entirely different entities and attributes

**Structure (per chapter)**

```json
{
  "chapter": 0,
  "MI": "...",
  "RI": "...",
  "UI": "...",
  "meta": {
    "target_words": 123,
    "high_words": 123,
    "ratio": 1.0
  }
}
```

**Notes**
- Target length is proportional to the word count of the high-narrativity text.
- Distractors are generated independently per chapter.

---

## 4. `qa/qa.json`

**Purpose**  
True/False questions used to evaluate recall performance.

**Generated by**
- `scripts/04_generate_qa.py`

**Structure (per chapter)**

```json
{
  "chapter": 0,
  "questions": [
    "Is it true that ...?"
  ],
  "answers": [
    "True",
    "False"
  ],
  "topics": [
    "location",
    "entity"
  ]
}
```

**Notes**
- One question is generated per event.
- False questions are created by replacing only one attribute
with another event’s value from the same chapter.
- Questions do not use names shortened forms or paraphrased content.
